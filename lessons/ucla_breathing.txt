Find a relaxed, comfortable position
Seated on a chair or on the floor, on a cushion
Keep your back upright, but not too tight
Hands resting wherever they're comfortable
Tongue on the roof of your mouth or wherever it's comfortable.
And you can notice your body
From the inside
Noticing the shape of your body, the weight, touch
And let yourself relax
And become curious about your body
Seated here
The sensations of your body
The touch
The connection with the floor
The chair
Relax any areas of tightness or tension
Just breathe
Soften
And now begin to tune into your breath
In your body
Feeling the natural flow of breath
Don't need to do anything to your breath
Not long not short just natural
And notice where you feel your breath in your body
It might be in your abdomen
It may be in your chest or throat
Or in your nostrils
See if you can feel the sensations of breath
One breath at a time
When one breath ends, the next breath begins
Now as you do this you might notice that your mind might start to wander
You might start thinking about other things
If this happens this is not a problem
It's very natural
Just notice that your mind has wandered
You can say "thinking" or "wandering" in your head softly
And then gently redirect your attention right back to the breathing
So we'll stay with this for some time in silence
Just a short time
Noticing our breath

60
From time to time getting lost in thought and returning to our breath
See if you can be really kind to yourself in the process
200
And once again you can notice your body, your whole body, seated here
Let yourself relax even more deeply
And then offer yourself some appreciation
For doing this practice today
Whatever that means to you
Finding a sense of ease and wellbeing for yourself and this day
