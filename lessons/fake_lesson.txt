## Meditation Guide

# 30 Setup Phase
10 Sitting up straight with eyes open 
10 Breathing in through the nose, out through the mouth
10 In through the nose, out through the mouth
10 Take nice and deep breaths, so if someone was sitting next to you they would be able to hear it
10 In, and out
5 On the next out breath, closing the eyes

# Assimilate Environment Phase
Return to normal breathing
Feel the weight of the body
Legs on the floor
Hands on the lap
Listen to the noise around you, not reaching out for the noise, but simply letting them come in and go out
Can you notice any less obvious sounds
Are there any smells
Perform a body scan
Starting in the head, scan right the way down to the toes
Check each part of the body, fingers, ears, knees
Can you sense an emotion throughout the body

# Repetition Phase
Start to count with each breath, 1 as you breathe in, 2 as you breathe out, up to a maximum count of 10

# Freedom Phase
Let go of any thoughts you have
Let the brain do whatever it wants

# Release Phase
Come back to the enviroment
Can you smell anything, hear anything
Feel the weigth of the body
When you're ready, open your eyes

# Reflection Phase
How did that feel
Do you feel calmer
More ready to face the day
Don't forget to incorporate throughout the day
