## Meditation Guide

# Setup Phase
It's a really straightforward technique
All you need to do is sit back and relax and allow your body and mind to unwind
So just take a moment to get comfortable
Doesn't matter if you're sitting on a chair or on the floor, whatever suits you best
But I'd like you to begin with your eyes open
Not really staring at any one particular point
Just a nice soft focus, aware of the space around you in the room
And as you sit there I'd just like you to take a couple of nice deep breaths, breathing in through the nose, out through the mouth
as you breathe in through the nose just focusing on the chest expanding, the lungs filling with air
and as you breathe out just noticing how the body softens, each time it exhales
now as you just these first few breaths, I'd like you to do it loud enough so that if someone was sat next to you they'd actually hear you breathing
just for these first couple of breaths
breathing in through the nose, and out through the mouth
and with the next out breath, just gently closing the eyelids and feeling the weight of the body as it presses down against the chair or the floor below you
just noticing whether the weight falls directly down through the middle of the body, or perhaps a little bit more to the left or to the right
10
just feeling the sensation of the soles of the feet resting on the floor
and of the hands and the arms, just resting on the legs, or the lap
just bringing the mind into the body, becoming more aware of the physical senses
and in just the same way, I'd just like you to begin to notice any sounds
I think very often we see external sounds as something that potentially gets in the way of a quiet mind
but in this exercise we're actually going to use these different sounds
so for just 10 or 20 seconds, noticing all the different sounds going on around you right now
20
and then just bringing the attention back to the body again
just starting to notice how the body feels right now
very often we're very busy doing things, thinking about things, we're not really aware of how the body feels
so starting off at the top of the head, just take the next 20 seconds or so, just to gently scan down through the body
just starting to notice which areas feel perhaps a little tight or tense in some way
which areas feel nice and relaxed
so we're not trying to change anything, we're not judging it, just building up a picture
starting to notice how the body feels
as you scan down towards to the toes
10
now as you're scanning down in this way you probably already started to notice that as the body breathes it craetes a rising and falling sensation
just starting to notice where in the body you feel that movement most clearly, it might be in the stomach, around the diaphragm, the chest
maybe even the shoulders
not trying to change it, allowing the body to breathe quite naturally, its own rhythm, its own time
becoming more aware of the rhythm of the breath, whether it is long or short, deep or shallow
and just to help you maintain that focus on the breath
just silently starting to count the breaths as they past
one with the rising sensation
two with the falling sensation
then three, then four, just up to a count of ten
when you get to ten, you can stop, and start again at one
just try that a couple of times through
remember allow thoughts to come and go but the moment you get distracted, just gently bringing the attention back again
to that physical sensation of the breath
30

perfectly normal for the mind to wander off
remember as soon as you get distracted, as soon as you realise that the mind has wandered off, just gently bringing the attention back and picking it up at the number you left off on
30

and just for a moment now
I'd like you to let go of any focus at all
not even focusing on the breath now
I'd like you to allow the mind to do whatever it wants to do
if it wants to think, let it think
if it wants to be busy, let it be busy
no sense of effort or control, just allowing the mind to do whatever it wants to do
30

and then just bringing the attention back to the body
just starting to become a little bit more aware of the physical sensations in the body again
the feeling of contact againgst the chair or the floor
the soles of the feet on the floor
the hands and the arms on the legs
starting to notice any sounds around
and just bringing yourself back in to the immediate environment around you
and in your own time, you can just gently open the eyes
have a stretch if you'd like to and just sit back in the chair
so how does it feel having taken a few minutes out of the day, do you feel a little bit calmer? more relaxed?

don't worry if there are still lots of throughts running around, that's perfectly normal at this stage
and the mind can change a lot from day to day as well, but before you jump up right now to get on with things
just take a few moments to sit back and appreciate how good it feels to get a little more headspace
